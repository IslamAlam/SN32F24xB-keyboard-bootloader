# A bootloader for SN32F24xB-based keyboards
ou
## Known issues

- JTAG or SWD pins used as part of keyboard matrix can't be used for bootloader entry

## Compiling

A recent version of the [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) is recommended for building this project. In order to build, execute the following commands:

```

# add dir to docker and run build inside it
docker run -it -v ~/qmk:/qmk qmkfm/base_container

# make sure to install following
apt update
apt install -y cmake g++-arm-linux-gnueabi g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```

## Flashing the bootloader

The bootloader is flashed with [stlink](https://github.com/texane/stlink). You need an external SWD programmer to flash the bootloader; I'm using a $2 st-link clone which works well enough. It looks like this:

![](/img/stlink.jpg)

To program the board, connect the adapter to SWD pads and execute:

```
sudo st-flash erase
sudo st-flash write /path/to/your/bootloader-your_keyboard.bin 0x8000000
```

After the device reboots, it should jump into the bootloader. You should see something similar to:

```
[4543676.396262] usb 2-1.5.3.4: new full-speed USB device number 78 using ehci-pci
[4543676.505971] usb 2-1.5.3.4: New USB device found, idVendor=6b62, idProduct=0000, bcdDevice= 2.01
[4543676.505976] usb 2-1.5.3.4: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=1, SerialNumber=1
[4543676.505978] usb 2-1.5.3.4: Product: DFU
[4543676.505981] usb 2-1.5.3.4: Manufacturer: DFU
[4543676.505983] usb 2-1.5.3.4: SerialNumber: DFU
```

## Entering the bootloader

The bootloader is entered when any of the following is true during power up:

- A bootloader entry flag is set - this would be set by QMK when you press the `RESET` keycode.
- There is no firmware uploaded yet - this works by checking the validity of the reset vector (only checks the stack pointer)
- A button is pressed (inherited from the parent project, but not really used)
- A button from the keyboard matrix is pressed - this should be the main method used to enter the bootloader.

The last method is new to this fork. It enters the bootloader if a keyboard button is held during power up, i.e. a user holds a specific button while plugging in the keyboard. This is safer compared to QMK bootmagic feature as it does not rely on a valid firmware being present.

The specific button to be held will be different depending on the keyboard. See below on how to configure it.

## Flashing keyboard firmware

The QMK firmware can be flashed with `dfu-util`. This bootloader uses a different vendor and product IDs; it also doesn't implement multiple alternate settings present in the parent project. The `DFU_ARGS` you want to use in QMK are as follows:

```
DFU_ARGS = -d 6b62:0000 -R
```

## Adding a new keyboard

To add a new keyboard, first edit `CMakeLists.txt` and append a new `add_bootloader()` entry at the end, e.g.

```
add_bootloader(new_keyboard)
```

Then, edit `src/config.h` and before the `#else` with the `#error` branch, add:

```
#elif defined(TARGET_NEW_KEYBOARD)
/* Configuration options - see other entries for a reference */
```

Finally, recompile the project and you should see your very own `bootloader-new_keyboard.bin` in the build folder. See flashing instructions above for how to flash.

Before releasing your product, you should configure a way to enter the bootloader. The recommended way is by holding a keyboard matrix button on power up. Consider this schematic:

![](/img/schematic.png)

Suppose you want to enter the bootloader when K_4, the middle button in the matrix is held during power up. To scan that single keycode, we need the bootloader to output on `col1` (PB10) and read the result from `row1` (PA4). The following snippet from `config.h` properly sets it up:

```
#elif defined(TARGET_BASICPAD_V1)
    /* Middle key in the 3x3 keymatrix */
    #define BL_OUTPUT_BANK GPIOB
    #define BL_OUTPUT_PIN 10
    #define BL_INPUT_BANK GPIOA
    #define BL_INPUT_PIN 4
```

## Write protection

You could enable write protection for the first 8KB of memory so that the bootloader is not accidentally overwritten if e.g. there is a bug in QMK resulting in an erase of first few pages (it is important to note that the current implementation of the bootloader **does not** allow a user to overwrite itself). However, this is not a security feature and malicious code could easily bypass the protection.

First, obtain and compile a fork of `stlink` with support for writing option bytes on STM32F103: https://github.com/xyzz/stlink/tree/stm32f10-opt-bytes.

Prepare the option files:

```
echo "A5 5A" | xxd -r -p - > opt-head.bin
echo "FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FC 03 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00" | xxd -r -p - > opt-tail.bin
```

Flash the option files and the bootloader as a single command:

```
st-flash opterase && st-flash write opt-head.bin 0x1FFFF800 && st-flash write PATH/TO/YOUR/BOOTLOADER.BIN 0x8000000 && st-flash write opt-tail.bin 0x1FFFF802 && st-flash --area=option read
```

Confirm that at the end `st-flash` output the following:

```
2020-01-12T15:40:09 INFO common.c: SRAM size: 0x5000 bytes (20 KiB), Flash: 0x10000 bytes (64 KiB) in pages of 1024 bytes
A5 5A FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FC 03 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00
```

The sequence executed by the commands is:

1) Erase the option block; this enables read out protection
2) Disable read protection by writing `A5 5A`; this triggers a mass erase of user flash
3) Write the bootloader
4) Enable write protection for the bootloader by writing the remainder of the option block: `FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FC 03 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00` (`FC 03` protects first two 4KB pages)

After the commands are executed, the device should reboot into DFU mode and you will be able to flash QMK as usual.

If at any point you wish to remove write protection, perform an `opterase` and then flash the default option block: `A5 5A FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00 FF 00`.
